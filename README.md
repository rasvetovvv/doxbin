# StrapBin
StrapBin is a **Bootstrap** implementation of the original Doxbin created by nacash. It uses the Bootstrap
theme **Darkly** from http://bootswatch.com/ and it is integrated with all usual BootStrap features. This
version has also been hand checked for vulnerabilities and it's code has been cleaned up.

## Installation
